Future data privacy plan:

As the app grows and further becomes used by greater proportions of local farmers we want to utilise the data generated to further forecast and assist with growing local agricultural markets. To prevent the exploitation of local farmers whilst still allowing data to be analysed we suggest the use of simulated data from Bayesian posterior dsitributions to protect farmers from statistical attacks targeted at small populations.

The identification of farmers and their sales in data samples can be mitigated by using Bayesian style thinking. The data can be served using a probabilistic lambda function that returns a vector of samples based on a prior informed through the data collected by the app and UN. These samples will be given with a level of uncertainty so that those attempting to utilise samples from low amounts of samples will know that their predictions are ill-informed. The number of samples per API call can be specified, and the prior distribution can theoretically be informed at any level of spatial granularity, helping to protect small groups of vulnerable farmers against exploitation of their data.
